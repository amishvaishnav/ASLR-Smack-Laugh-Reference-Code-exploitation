# Exploitation of C Files for ASLR Bypass

## Overview

This repository contains the C code files used for the ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) Smack & Laugh reference paper. The focus is on exploiting the binaries generated by the C code in the paper using techniques learned in ENPM 691. The project demonstrates various ways to perform buffer overflow attacks.

## Reference Paper

The reference paper titled "ASLR Smack & Laugh" can be found [here](https://www.icir.org/matthias/cs161-sp13/aslr-bypass.pdf). This paper serves as the foundation for the techniques applied in this project.

## Exploitation Techniques

The project explores and demonstrates different methods for performing buffer overflow attacks. Techniques learned in ENPM 691, including the use of gdb (GNU Debugger) and bash scripting, are applied to exploit vulnerabilities in the provided C code.
